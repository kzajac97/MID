# MID

Repoitory created during modelling and identification course in univsersity. It contains custom implementation of various statistical estimators and some experiments. It contains:

* Pseudo-random number generators
  * Rejection sampling
  * Inversted distribution generator

* Probability density estimators
  * Histogram
  * Kernel denisity estimator 

* Distribution properties
  * Expected value
  * Variance and covariance
  * Correlation

* Static system estimators
  * Orthogonal estimator based on different orthogonal basis functions
  * Kernel estimator (alson known as Nadaraya-Watson estimator)

* Linear dynamic system estimators (not merged to `main`)
  * Least squares
  * Recursive least squares
